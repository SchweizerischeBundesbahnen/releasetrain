# Releasetrain
This is a tool that is easy to use and that integrates 
* Parametrized Jenkins Jobs, 
* Email Notification Actions

in one simple configurable application.

The main goal ist to schedule builds with custom Release Numbers and other Parameters. It can run as a standalone Spring Boot Webapp.

## Advantages
- It uses an existig git repo to store Action Configurations and the corresponding Calendars with custom Parameters
- A Calendar can have a custom amount of Columns, which are mapped automatically to parametrized Jenkins Jobs
- Scheduled Jobs can be launced from the Spring Boot app or from a generated Jenkins Job. It suffices to launch a Maven Mojo, 
which will be installed automatically from Maven Central.

## Updates
- 0.9.6 Various Cleanup taks
        Removed the View and the Logic t run releasetrain as a Jenkins Job
        Bugfixes

- 0.9.4 Saving the Config before refresing on the git configuration
        Blocking Window when refreshing git connection
        Rest call to http://search.maven.org/ for the latest version when generating the jenkins job 

## For Developers
- Feel free to fork or to create a pull requests.
- Implementations of more Custom Actions are welcome, please let me know if you need help or if you need better interfaces.

### Travis-CI: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/releasetrain.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/releasetrain)

## For Users
### Setup

1. Download the latest Spring Boot App: [From Maven Central](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/ch/sbb/releasetrain/webui/0.9.6/webui-0.9.6.jar).
2. Start from command line the command: _java -jar webui-0.9.6.jar_.
3. On Windows the default browser will open and the webapp is shown at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Usage
#### On the Menu open Start as shown below:
![](docs/2016-09-06_18_13_23-localhost_8080_app.htm.png)
- Here you have to provide the connection to an existing git repo.
- The git branch is required to store the configuration files in Yaml Format; the branch will be created if it does not yet exist.
- You can see the 2 green buttons for read and write access to the git connection and branch. 
- If you see errors in the error field, fix the config and "Check Connection for Config" again.
- The provided connection information will be stored in the user's home directory under ./releasetrain/gitConfig.yaml.
The password is lightly encrypted in order not to store it in  plaintext (however, it's easy to find the key so, it's not a big deal to decrypt at all...)

#### Insert the Default Action Configuration for Jenkins and Email Actions:
![](docs/2016-09-06_20_13_19-localhost_8080_app.htm.png)
- The build token is for Jenkins Jobs with the "Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts)" selected

![](docs/2016-09-06_20_14_43-localhost_8080_app.htm.png)
- Provide the default e-mail parameters. In this version there is no option for an SMTP Server with authentication.
Please file a ticket or open a pull request if you need this option.
- The default actions will be stored in a file in the branch in the configured git repo.

#### Implement your new Actions:
![](docs/2016-09-06_20_15_39-localhost_8080_actions.htm.png)
- First insert the Name of the Action, the Action will have its own Calendar with 1 to n scheduled events.
- An Action can have one or more Actions (Jenkins and Email Actions).

![](docs/2016-09-06_20_16_27-localhost_8080_actions.htm.png)
- An Action can have one or more Actions (Jenkins and Email Actions)

![](docs/2016-09-06_20_17_01-localhost_8080_actions.htm.png)
- Every Action has its own Configuration.
- You can set a time offset for every Action; an Action with offset 0:00 will start right at time given in the schedule.
- An time offset means that the execution of this step will wait for the provided time to finish.

#### Create the Calendar for each Action:
![](docs/2016-09-06_20_19_52-localhost_8080_actions.htm.png)
- You can add columns as shown above. The column Name will be automatically mapped to Jenkins Action Parameters and to Email Text Variables.

![](docs/2016-09-06_20_20_30-localhost_8080_actions.htm.png)
- As shown above you can disable Columns if not required for the action.

![](docs/2016-09-06_20_21_21-localhost_8080_actions.htm.png)
- With New Entry you now can schedule your Actions whenever you need to run them.
- In the State Column you can see the State of Actions already Succeded or in Error State.
